Password Creator:
This is a simple password generator GUI application built using Python's tkinter module. This offers improved functionality from a smaller script shared on pythongeeks.org The application allows users to generate secure passwords of specified lengths, with options for character repetition and linking the password to an account name. The generated passwords are displayed in the GUI and saved to a file along with the associated account name and creation date/time.

Usage:
Run the password_generator.py script.
Enter the desired password length, choose whether to allow character repetition, and provide an account name (optional).
Click the "Generate secure password" button to generate a password.
The generated password will be displayed in the GUI, and it will also be saved to a file called passwords.txt along with the account name and creation date/time.
Click the "Clear fields" button to clear the input fields and generate a new password.
After the script finishes running, a pop-up box will show the author's GitHub account address.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
